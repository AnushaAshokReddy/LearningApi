"A restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) is a fascinating software component that has some similarities to a basic neural network. An RBM has two sets of nodesâ€”visible and hidden. Each set of nodes can act as either inputs or outputs relative to the other set. Each node has a value of zero or one and these values are calculated using probability rather than deterministically."
