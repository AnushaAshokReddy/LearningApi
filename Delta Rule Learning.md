|Delta Rule Learning
Delta rule learning is a algorithm which uses gradient decent for updating weights of the inputs to neurons. It is a particular special type of Back propagation algorithm. Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that locates a local minimum of a function by taking proportional steps towards negative gradient of the function as the current point.
